+Project Description:
The purpose of this assignment is helping you understand the nuances of 
the heap data structure studied in class.

+Project Approach & Conclusion:
I approached the project like most others except this time, I spent a significant amount more time working on it 
immediately after it was assigned. In regards to implementing the NodeHeap.class, completing the toArray() and
the fromArray() were by far the easiest that they could be done without any of the other methods being complete.
I did however spend the most time programming the add(), remove(), siftDown(), and heapSort().
Though I say that I spent a lot of time on the add() and remove(), it doesn't show because I kept trying multiple
ways of implementing them so that they maintained the complexity of O(logn). Also, I really got to experience just
how troublesome recursion can be if not done properly. Overall, I feel I learned the most during this programming
project compared to the other two completed in CS 240 but I also feel like I performed the worst. I wasn't able to
complete the portion of the project where I maintain the complexity because I tried so hard to try to do it in a more 
unconventional manner which ended up wasting a lot of my time. Next time I should just focus on getting the program
to work and then refine it rather than trying to refine it every step of the way.
